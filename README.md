# Manta Calendar

Manta Calendar is an Obsidian Community plugin that finds dates in Markdown notes and opens the source note from a calendar or agenda.

- The local calendar reads the Vault directly and needs no account or separate database.
- Optional Google Calendar sync uses desktop loopback OAuth with PKCE. Tokens and calendar requests travel between the user's computer and Google, not through a Manta server.
- Version 4.0.0 supports desktop Obsidian on macOS and Windows. CI covers date parsing, source policy, conflict handling, and mocked Google API flows; live-account end-to-end sync is not part of CI.

**[Install in Obsidian](https://community.obsidian.md/plugins/link-calendar) · [Try the demo Vault](https://github.com/woonyong-choi/obsidian-navigator-demo-vault/releases/latest) · [User guide](docs/user-guide.md)**

Version: **4.0.0** · Obsidian **1.13.0+** · **macOS and Windows**. See [release notes](CHANGELOG.md) for changes and the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for work in progress and plans.

A six-second loop of the current view using sample notes. Timing is condensed. This is a view fixture; the original Obsidian capture is below.

## Install and try

1. Open the [existing Community entry](https://community.obsidian.md/plugins/link-calendar) in Obsidian, then install and enable it.
2. Add `- 2026-09-10 scheduled · Project check-in` to a normal note, outside a code block.
3. Run **Open Manta Calendar**, navigate to September 2026, and select September 10. Select the event to open its note.

The local calendar needs no account. Optional Google sync connects selected note folders to a dedicated **Manta Calendar**; manual two-way sync is opt-in. Sign in with your own Google account in your default browser. Authorization and calendar requests go directly between your computer and Google, with no Manta server or personal domain in between. [Setup and limitations](docs/google-calendar.md).

Upgrading from 3.x requires one new Google sign-in on each computer. Existing calendars, source selections, and event mappings are preserved. If the old calendar is unavailable through the new connection, select **Create calendar if unavailable** to prepare an empty Manta Calendar. Old events remain in their original calendar; synchronization is a separate action. Version 4 supports desktop Obsidian on macOS and Windows; it does not run on iOS or Android.

Manual installation: download the three plugin files from [Releases](https://github.com/woonyong-choi/manta-calendar/releases/latest) into `.obsidian/plugins/link-calendar/`, then reload Obsidian.
